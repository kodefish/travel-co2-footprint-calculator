** Usage
*** Data visualization
Data processing and visualization is done via python scripts. In order to have
everything working, you must have the following dependencies installed:

+ =bokeh=: visualization library
+ =pandas=: processing and querying csv data
+ =tqdm=: displaying a progress bar

You can install all these packages using =conda=:
#+BEGIN_SRC
conda install bokeh pandas tqdm
#+END_SRC

**** Data Processing
To visualize the data, first process it. This can be done using the
=process_data.py= script. It will parse the =legs.csv= folder, extract all the
user ids, then ask which user you would like to process. Then it will ask which
journey of the selected user you would like to process. You can of course both
times say all.

It will then output the sensor data in one csv file per user and per journey, in
the =processed_data= folder (which will be created if necessary). This folder
follows the following hierarchy:

+ =./processed_data=
  + =user_id=
    + =leg_id=
      + =acc_readings.csv=
      + =bluetooth_scans.csv=
      + =gyro_readings.csv=
      + =locations_scans.csv==
      + =magn_readings.csv=
      + =wifi_scans.csv=

To start processing the data, call:
#+BEGIN_SRC
python process_data.py
#+END_SRC
       
**** Data Visualization
Once the data has been processes, visualizing it can be done via the
=visualization.py= script. The script will first ask which user's journey and
which journey in particular you want to see. It will then plot the data from
each sensor into a separate figure. You have the option to visualize the plots
in a column layout, grid layout or both (default). This can be specified as command line
arguments.

To visualize the data, call:
#+BEGIN_SRC
python visualization.py
#+END_SRC

+ =-c= or =-column= to view column layout
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  python visualization.py -c
  #+END_SRC
+ =-g= or =-grid= to view grid layout
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  python visualization.py -g
  #+END_SRC

The script will open the generated plots in a new browser tab. You can play
around (pan and zoom) with the graph in the grid mode (for some reason, tools are not available
yet in the column view).
       
**** Windowing
To aggregate the data into windows of a fixed size call the script windowing.py (with the optional parameter "window_size" which is the window lenght in milliseconds).
This will read out the folder "processed_data" so make sure you have all data processed before!
The resulting windows will be saved in the file "features.csv".

    
**** Machine Learning
To test the accuracy of the features extracted from the data and saved in "features.csv" you can simply invoke machine.py which will split the data into test and training set and then perform ML and report the resulting accuracy.

**** Features
List of all features used (in order):
+ acc_mean
+ avg_con_bt
+ gyro_mean
+ max_speed
+ avg_speed
+ distance_travelled
+ mag_mean
+ acc_mixed_0
+ ...
+ acc_mixed_29
+ gyro_mixed_0
+ ...
+ gyro_mixed_29
